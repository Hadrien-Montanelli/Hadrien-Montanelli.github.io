	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2017 from the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>.
	My PhD, under the supervision of <a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/">Nick Trefethen</a>, 
	involved numerical algorithms for differential equations with periodicity.</p>
	<p>Prior to this I completed a Masters in Applied Mathematics at the
	<a href="http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/home/home-page-en-379161.kjsp?RH=ACCUEIL">University of Toulouse</a>
	and a Masters in Aerospace Engineering at the

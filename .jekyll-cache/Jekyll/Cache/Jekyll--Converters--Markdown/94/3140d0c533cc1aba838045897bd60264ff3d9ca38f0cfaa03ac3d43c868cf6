<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08900.pdf">One of the papers</a> I wrote during my Ph.D. at Oxford was just accepted in <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/mathematics-and-computers-in-simulation">Mathematics and Computers in Simulation</a>. In this post, I review the main ideas of the paper.</p>

<h2>Stiff periodic PDEs</h2>

<p>We are interested in computing smooth solutions of stiff PDEs of the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u_t = \mathcal{S}(u) = \mathcal{L}u + \mathcal{N}(u), \quad u(0,X)=u_0(X), \quad \text{periodic boundary conditions,}
\label{PDE}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">u(t,X)</script> is a function of time <script type="math/tex">t</script> and space <script type="math/tex">X</script>, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}</script> is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients on a domain in one, 
two or three space dimensions and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}</script> is a nonlinear differential (or non-differential) operator of lower order with constant coefficients and on the same domain.</p>

<p>In applications, PDEs of this kind typically arise when two or more different physical processes are combined, and many PDEs of interest in 
science and engineering take this form. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteweg%E2%80%93de_Vries_equation">Korteweg–de Vries equation</a> <script type="math/tex">u_t = -u_{xxx} - uu_x</script>, the starting point of the study of nonlinear waves and solitons, couples third-order linear dispersion with first-order convection, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen–Cahn_equation">Allen–Cahn equation</a> <script type="math/tex">u_t = \epsilon u_{xx} + u - u^3</script> couples second-order linear 
diffusion with a nondifferentiated cubic reaction term.</p>

<p>Often a system of equations rather than a single scalar equation is involved, for example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system">reaction-diffusion systems</a> such as the Gray–Scott and Schnakenberg equations, which involve two components coupled together. (The importance of coupling of nonequal diffusion constants in science was made famous by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> in 1952 in the most highly-cited of all his papers.) Fourth-order terms also arise, for example in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation">Cahn–Hilliard equation</a>, whose solutions describe structures of alloys, and in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto%E2%80%93Sivashinsky_equation">Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation</a>, related to combustion problems among others, whose solutions are chaotic. The figure at the top of this post shows six examples of solutions of such PDEs.</p>

<h2>Expoential integrators</h2>

<h2>Numerical experiments and Chebfun</h2>

<p>We have tested 30 exponential integrators on 11 model problems in 1D, 2D and 3D, and have observed considerable differences in stability and efficiency.
As expected, the schemes did not exhibit any order reduction (periodic boundary conditions).
The main conclusion is that it is difficult to find a method that outperforms ETDRK4 for all the PDEs we have considered.</p>

<p>Our numerical experiments were performed using MATLAB and have been embedded within Chebfun.
More specifically, the \texttt{spin}, \texttt{spin2} and \texttt{spin3} codes implement a Fourier spectral method and exponential integrators to solve PDEs in 1D, 2D and 3D periodic domains.
(Note that \texttt{spin} stands for \textbf{s}tiff \textbf{P}DE \textbf{in}tegrator.)
These have been one of the most major additions to Chebfun in recent years from a user point of view.
The simplest way to see \texttt{spin} in action is to type simply \texttt{spin(‘ks’)} (for the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation) or \texttt{spin2(‘gl2’)} (for the 2D Ginzburg–Landau equation) to invoke an example computation.
It is also possible to define your own PDE using the \texttt{spinop} class.</p>

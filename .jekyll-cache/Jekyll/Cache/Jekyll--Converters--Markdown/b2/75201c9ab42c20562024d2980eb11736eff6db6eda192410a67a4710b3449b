<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08900.pdf">One of the papers</a> I wrote during my Ph.D. at Oxford was just accepted in <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/mathematics-and-computers-in-simulation">Mathematics and Computers in Simulation</a>. In this post, I review the main ideas of the paper.</p>

<p>We are interested in computing smooth solutions of stiff PDEs of the form
<script type="math/tex">u_t = \mathcal{S}(u) = \mathcal{L}u + \mathcal{N}(u), \quad u(0,X)=u_0(X), \quad \text{periodic boundary conditions,}
\label{PDE}</script></p>

<p>\noindent where $u(t,X)$ is a function of time $t$ and space $X$, $\mathcal{L}$ is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients on a domain in one, 
two or three space dimensions and $\mathcal{N}$ is a nonlinear differential (or non-differential) operator of lower order with constant coefficients and on the same domain.\footnote{$X$ 
denotes a space variable in 1D, 2D or 3D. Throughout this paper, we will use the variables $x$ in 1D, $(x,y)$ in 2D and $(x,y,z)$ in 3D. The domain will
be an interval in 1D, a square in 2D and a cube in 3D.}
In applications, PDEs of this kind typically arise when two or more different physical processes are combined, and many PDEs of interest in 
science and engineering take this form.<br />
For example, the Korteweg–de Vries equation $u_t = -u_{xxx} - uu_x$, the starting point of the study of nonlinear waves and solitons, 
couples third-order linear dispersion with first-order convection, and the Allen–Cahn equation $u_t = \epsilon u_{xx} + u - u^3$ couples second-order linear 
diffusion with a nondifferentiated cubic reaction term.<br />
Often a system of equations rather than a single scalar equation is involved, for example in the Gray–Scott and Schnakenberg equations, which 
involve two components coupled together.<br />
(The importance of coupling of nonequal diffusion constants in science was made famous by Alan Turing in the most highly-cited of all 
his papers~\cite{turing1952}.)
Fourth-order terms also arise, for example in the Cahn–Hilliard  equation, whose solutions describe structures of alloys, and in the 
Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, related to combustion problems among others, whose solutions are chaotic. 
Other examples of stiff PDEs include the Ginzburg–Landau, nonlinear Schr"odinger (NLS) and Swift–Hohenberg equations.
Figure~\ref{iconic} shows six examples of solutions of such PDEs.</p>

<h2> Scientific modelling and the importance of peer review</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve been carefully paying attention to the policies that governments have chosen to apply in response to the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">coronavirus pandemic</a>, and, having many friends and colleagues in the UK, in particular to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan">UK governmentâ€™s action plan</a>. 
Long story short, at first, the UKâ€™s action plan varied from other countriesâ€™ plans by not imposing much restrictions on the population, and relied on the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">herd immunity</a>; see, <i>e.g.</i>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-herd-immunity-uk-boris-johnson/608065/">this article</a>. 
(Luckily, the UK government has now come to reason and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/a-chilling-scientific-paper-helped-upend-us-and-uk-coronavirus-strategies/2020/03/17/aaa84116-6851-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html">changed its mind</a>, based on <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">this comprehensive report</a> from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College</a>.)
Following the presentation of the original plan based on herd immunity, I had a very heated argument with a friend of mine working for the UK government in London.
She is not a scientist (she studied English literature), but claimed that her government â€˜â€˜knew betterâ€™â€™ and 
that its decisions were â€˜â€˜based on science.â€™â€™
Well, as a mathematician and scientist, this <i>really</i> (<i>really</i>, <i>really</i>) puzzled me.</p>

<p>First, in this context, there is no such thing as (a single and true) science.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">Mathematics</a> <i>is</i> science, in the sense that everything can be either true or false.
Here, what we have are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling">scientific models</a>, based on simplistic assumptions,
which try and represent the reality.
Those models often use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">statisitical data</a> and lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation">numerical simulations</a>, which give us a snapshot of the future, <i>i.e.</i>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction">prediction</a>.
This process of modelling, using data and performing numerical simulations introduces many errors, including modelling errors (the model is a simplified version of the phenomenon weâ€™re describing), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics)">sample selection bias</a> (the data is not representative of the population), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_error">numerical errors</a> (the problem we end up solving on the computer is itself an approximation of the model), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug">software bugs</a>.
My point is that this process is far from being perfect, but still gives us <i>some</i> indication of what the future <i>may</i> be.</p>

<p>Second, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research">research</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy">Academia</a> is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review">peer review</a>. 
Once researchers believe theyâ€™ve come up with a new model and have obtained interesting results, they send their work to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal">scientific journal</a>.
This is the crucial step where experts in the field chosen by the journal can validate or invalidate the model, chek the data and verify the algorithms, comment on the results, make suggestions, ask questions and ultimaltey decided whether the paper should or should not be published.
The model and the numerical simulations that led to the UK governmentâ€™s original plan were <i>never</i> published, even though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Whitty">Prof Chris Witty</a> said <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51892402">they intended to</a>; more than 500 academics critized the plan <a href="http://maths.qmul.ac.uk/~vnicosia/UK_scientists_statement_on_coronavirus_measures.pdf">in an open letter</a>.
As a scientist, how arrogant do you have to be to believe that you know better than everybody else and therefore doesnâ€™t need to be peer reviewed?
As a politician or as an individual, believing so blindly in science is dangerous, especially when other countries adopt a completely different strategy; science isnâ€™t a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma">dogma</a>.</p>

<p>Third, when the life of so many people is at risk (about 500,000 deaths in the UK in the worst-case scenario predicted by Imperial College), shouldnâ€™t we be overly precautious anyway? Iâ€™d rather have a government that may sightly overreact but protects vulnerable people.</p>

<h2>A simple model for the exponential spread of diseases</h2>

<p>I just wanted to give a simple model for the spread of a disease and illustrate how confinment helps to flatten the curve. 
This section was inspired by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">this excellent article</a> from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a>.
<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports"> WHO situation reports</a></p>

<p>Here are the assumptions of my model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>indivuals are represented by points on a rectangular 2D domain;</li>
  <li>at every regular time interval, they move in a (normally distributed) random direction;</li>
  <li>if a sick indiviual get close enough to an healthy individual, the latter becomes sick;</li>
  <li>once they're sick, they'll recover after some time;</li>
  <li>once they've recovered, they cannot get sick again or carry the disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>These assumptions are indeed overly simplistic, but let me tell you something, even papers like this study from</p>

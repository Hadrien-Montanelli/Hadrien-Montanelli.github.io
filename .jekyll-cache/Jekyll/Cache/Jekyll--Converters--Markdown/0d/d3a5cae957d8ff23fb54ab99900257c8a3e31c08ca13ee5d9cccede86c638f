I"<p>Iâ€™ve been carefully paying attention to the policies that governments have chosen to apply in response to the current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">coronavirus pandemic</a>, and, having many friends and colleagues in the UK, in particular to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan">UK governmentâ€™s action plan</a>. 
Long story short, at first, the UKâ€™s action plan varied from other countriesâ€™ plans by not imposing much restrictions on the population, and relied on the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">herd immunity</a>; see, <i>e.g.</i>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-herd-immunity-uk-boris-johnson/608065/">this article</a>. 
Following the presentation of the plan, I had a very heated argument with a friend of mine working for the UK government in London.
She is not a scientist (she studied English literature), but claimed that her government â€˜â€˜knew betterâ€™â€™ and 
that their decisions were â€˜â€˜based on science.â€™â€™
Well, as a mathematician and scientist, it <i>really</i> (<i>really</i>, <i>really</i>) puzzled me.
(Luckily, the UK government has now come to reason and changed its mind, based on <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">this comprehensive report</a> from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College</a>.)</p>

<p>First, in this context, there is no such thing as (a single and true) science.
Mathematics, which I claim to know a little a bit about, <i>is</i> science, in the sense that everything can be either true or false.
Here, what we have are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling">scientific models</a>, based on simplistic assumptions,
which try and represent the reality.
Those models often lead to numerical simulations that give us a snapshot of the future. 
The results of the simulations should indeed help governments to make decisions, but decisions should not solely based on these models.</p>

<p>Based on the results of</p>

<p>However good our models are, we have made assumptions and those assumptions might or might not be realistic,</p>

<p>Second, it somehows assumes that the UK has the best models.</p>

<p>I went to Oxford like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Whitty">Chris Witty</a> and admire the UK University system, but Iâ€™m not so naive to believe that the models developed there are so much better than those of Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Caltech, etc.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll present a simple model for the exponential spread of diseases below, which is not too far from what experts in the field use.</p>

First, itâ€™s extremly hard to model</p>

<h2>A simple model for the exponential spread of diseases</h2>

<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">this article</a>
<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports"> WHO situation reports</a></p>

<p>Here are the assumptions of my model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>indivuals are represented by points on a rectangular 2D domain;</li>
  <li>at every regular time interval, they move in a (normally distributed) random direction;</li>
  <li>if a sick indiviual get close enough to an healthy individual, the latter becomes sick;</li>
  <li>once they're sick, they'll recover after some time;</li>
  <li>once they've recovered, they cannot get sick again or carry the disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>These assumptions are indeed overly simplistic, but let me tell you something, even papers like this study from</p>

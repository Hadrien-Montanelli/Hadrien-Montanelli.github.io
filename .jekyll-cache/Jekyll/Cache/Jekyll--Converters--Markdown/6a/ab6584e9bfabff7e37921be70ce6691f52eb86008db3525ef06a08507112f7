<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08900.pdf">One of the papers</a> I wrote during my Ph.D. at Oxford was just accepted in <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/mathematics-and-computers-in-simulation">Mathematics and Computers in Simulation</a>. In this post, I review the main ideas of the paper.</p>

<h2>Periodic stiff PDEs</h2>

<p>We are interested in computing smooth solutions of stiff PDEs of the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u_t = \mathcal{S}(u) = \mathcal{L}u + \mathcal{N}(u), \quad u(0,X)=u_0(X), \quad \text{periodic boundary conditions,}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">u(t,X)</script> is a function of time <script type="math/tex">t</script> and space <script type="math/tex">X</script>, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}</script> is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients on a domain in one, 
two or three space dimensions and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}</script> is a nonlinear differential (or non-differential) operator of lower order with constant coefficients and on the same domain.</p>

<p>In applications, PDEs of this kind typically arise when two or more different physical processes are combined, and many PDEs of interest in 
science and engineering take this form. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteweg%E2%80%93de_Vries_equation">Korteweg–de Vries equation</a> <script type="math/tex">u_t = -u_{xxx} - uu_x</script>, the starting point of the study of nonlinear waves and solitons, couples third-order linear dispersion with first-order convection, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen–Cahn_equation">Allen–Cahn equation</a> <script type="math/tex">u_t = \epsilon u_{xx} + u - u^3</script> couples second-order linear 
diffusion with a nondifferentiated cubic reaction term.</p>

<p>Often a system of equations rather than a single scalar equation is involved, for example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system">reaction-diffusion systems</a> such as the Gray–Scott and Schnakenberg equations, which involve two components coupled together. (The importance of coupling of nonequal diffusion constants in science was made famous by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> in 1952 in the most highly-cited of all his papers.) Fourth-order terms also arise, for example in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation">Cahn–Hilliard equation</a>, whose solutions describe structures of alloys, and in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto%E2%80%93Sivashinsky_equation">Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation</a>, related to combustion problems among others, whose solutions are chaotic. The figure at the top of this post shows six examples of solutions of such PDEs.</p>

<h2>Discretization in Fourier space</h2>

<p>Our paper describes and compares specialized methods that take advantage of two special features of the family of PDEs above. The first one is the periodic boundary conditions.
This allows us to discretize the spatial component with a Fourier spectral method on <script type="math/tex">N</script> points; the PDE becomes a system of <script type="math/tex">N</script> ODEs,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{u}' = \mathbf{L}\hat{u} + \mathbf{N}(\hat{u}), \quad \hat{u}(0)=\hat{u}_0,</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\hat{u}(t)</script> is the vector of <script type="math/tex">N</script> Fourier coefficients of the trigonometric interpolant of <script type="math/tex">u(t,X)</script> at time <script type="math/tex">t</script>, and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{L}</script> (a <script type="math/tex">N\times N</script> matrix) and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{N}</script> are the discretized versions of <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}</script> in Fourier space.</p>

<p>For example, in 1D on <script type="math/tex">[0, 2\pi]</script> with <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}u=u_{xx}</script> and an even number <script type="math/tex">N</script> of equispaced grid points <script type="math/tex">\{x_j=2\pi j/N\}_{j=0}^{N-1}</script>, we look for a solution <script type="math/tex">u(t,x)</script> of the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u(t,x) \approx \sum_{k=-N/2}^{N/2}{\hspace{-0.3cm}}'{\;\,} \hat{u}_k(t) e^{ikx}</script>

<p>with Fourier coefficients</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{u}_k(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}u(t,x_j)e^{-ikx_j}, \quad -\frac{N}{2}\leq k\leq \frac{N}{2}-1, \quad \hat{u}_{N/2}(t) = \hat{u}_{-N/2}(t).</script>

<p>(The prime on the summation sign signifies that the terms <script type="math/tex">k=\pm N/2</script> are halved.) Since FFT codes only store <script type="math/tex">N</script> coefficients, the vector <script type="math/tex">\hat{u}(t)</script> is defined as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{u}(t) = \Big(\frac{\hat{u}_{-N/2}}{2}+\frac{\hat{u}_{N/2}}{2}, \hat{u}_{-N/2+1}(t),\ldots,\hat{u}_{N/2-1}(t)\Big)^T.</script>

<p>For this PDE, <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{D}_N^{(2)}</script> is the (diagonal) <i>second-order Fourier differentiation matrix</i> with entries <script type="math/tex">-k^2</script>, <script type="math/tex">-N/2\leq k\leq N/2-1</script>.</p>

<h2>Expoential integrators</h2>

<p>The second special feature of those PDEs is that it is semilinear, <i>i.e.</i>, the higher-order terms of the equation are linear. 
Exponential integrators are a class of numerical methods for systems of ODEs that are aimed at taking advantage of this.
The linear part $\Lbf$, responsible for the stiffness, is integrated exactly using the matrix exponential while a numerical scheme is applied 
to $\mathbf{N}$.</p>

<p>One of the simplest exponential integrators, commonly known as the Exponential Time Differencing (ETD) Euler method, is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{u}^{n+1} = e^{h\Lbf}\hat{u}^n + h\ph_1(h\Lbf)\Nbf(\hat{u}^n),</script>

<p>where $h=t_{n+1}-t_n$ is the time-step and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\ph_1(z) = \frac{e^z-1}{z}.</script>

<p>This method has been rediscovered from many different viewpoints and has been known by several other names. It can be derived by considering the linearized version of \reff{ODE} on $[t_n,t_{n+1}]$,</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\hat{u}' = \Sbf(\hat{u}^n) + \Sbf_{\hat{u}}(\hat{u}^n)(\hat{u} - \hat{u}^n), \quad \hat{u}(t_n)=\hat{u}^n,</script>
\end{equation}</p>

<p>with exact solution at $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{u}^{n+1} = \hat{u}^n + h\ph_1(h\Sbf_{\hat{u}}(\hat{u}^n))\Sbf(\hat{u}^n).</script>

<p>Approximating $\Sbf_{\hat{u}}(\hat{u}^n)$ by $\Lbf$ in \reff{ExpEuler} leads to \reff{ETDEuler}.
Note that \reff{ExpEuler} defines a time-stepping scheme too, known as the exponential Euler method.
The problem with \reff{ExpEuler} is that the exact Jacobian $\Sbf_{\hat{u}}$, and its value under the exponential-like function $\ph_1$, need to be 
computed at each time-step.
This would involve a high computational cost, so typically one either does not compute $\ph_1$ but rather an approximation,
such as a Pad'e approximation, or else one uses an approximation to the Jacobian as opposed to the exact Jacobian.
The former approach contains the Rosenbrock methods~\cite{hairer1982, hairer1991, hochbruck2009, luan2014b, rosenbrock1963, vanderhouwen1977} 
and the Exponential Propagation Iterative methods of Runge-Kutta type (EPIRK)~\cite{rainwater2014, rainwater2015, tokman2006, tokman2011, tokman2012a}.
The latter approach is what we consider in our paper.</p>

<h2>Results of our numerical experiments and Chebfun</h2>

<p>We have tested 30 exponential integrators on 11 model problems in 1D, 2D and 3D, and have observed considerable differences in stability and efficiency.
As expected, the schemes did not exhibit any order reduction (periodic boundary conditions).
The main conclusion is that it is difficult to find a method that outperforms ETDRK4 for all the PDEs we have considered.</p>

<p>Our numerical experiments were performed using MATLAB and have been embedded within Chebfun.
More specifically, the \texttt{spin}, \texttt{spin2} and \texttt{spin3} codes implement a Fourier spectral method and exponential integrators to solve PDEs in 1D, 2D and 3D periodic domains.
(Note that \texttt{spin} stands for \textbf{s}tiff \textbf{P}DE \textbf{in}tegrator.)
These have been one of the most major additions to Chebfun in recent years from a user point of view.
The simplest way to see \texttt{spin} in action is to type simply \texttt{spin(‘ks’)} (for the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation) or \texttt{spin2(‘gl2’)} (for the 2D Ginzburg–Landau equation) to invoke an example computation.
It is also possible to define your own PDE using the \texttt{spinop} class.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08900.pdf">One of the papers</a> I wrote during my Ph.D. at Oxford was just accepted in <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/mathematics-and-computers-in-simulation">Mathematics and Computers in Simulation</a>. In this post, I review the main ideas of the paper.</p>

<p>We are interested in computing smooth solutions of stiff PDEs of the form
<script type="math/tex">u_t = \mathcal{S}(u) = \mathcal{L}u + \mathcal{N}(u), \quad u(0,X)=u_0(X), \quad \text{periodic boundary conditions,}
\label{PDE}</script></p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">u(t,X)</script> is a function of time <script type="math/tex">t</script> and space <script type="math/tex">X</script>, <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{L}</script> is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients on a domain in one, 
two or three space dimensions and <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{N}</script> is a nonlinear differential (or non-differential) operator of lower order with constant coefficients and on the same domain.
In applications, PDEs of this kind typically arise when two or more different physical processes are combined, and many PDEs of interest in 
science and engineering take this form.<br />
For example, the Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation <script type="math/tex">u_t = -u_{xxx} - uu_x</script>, the starting point of the study of nonlinear waves and solitons, 
couples third-order linear dispersion with first-order convection, and the Allenâ€“Cahn equation <script type="math/tex">u_t = \epsilon u_{xx} + u - u^3</script> couples second-order linear 
diffusion with a nondifferentiated cubic reaction term. Often a system of equations rather than a single scalar equation is involved, for example in the Grayâ€“Scott and Schnakenberg equations, which 
involve two components coupled together. (The importance of coupling of nonequal diffusion constants in science was made famous by Alan Turing in the most highly-cited of all 
his papers~\cite{turing1952}.) Fourth-order terms also arise, for example in the Cahnâ€“Hilliard  equation, whose solutions describe structures of alloys, and in the 
Kuramotoâ€“Sivashinsky equation, related to combustion problems among others, whose solutions are chaotic. 
Other examples of stiff PDEs include the Ginzburgâ€“Landau, nonlinear Schr"odinger (NLS) and Swiftâ€“Hohenberg equations.
The figure at the top of this post shows six examples of solutions of such PDEs.</p>

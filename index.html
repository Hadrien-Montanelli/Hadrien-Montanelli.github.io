	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University in the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics and at the Data Science Institute. 
        <p>My general research interests lie in nonlinear differential equations, and in particular my work so far has concerned the numerical computation of periodic solutions.
	More generally, I have broad interests and background in numerical analysis and numerical computation.<p>

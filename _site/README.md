# Hadrien Montanelli — Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal academic website, built with HTML, CSS, and static assets.  
It includes pages on my research, teaching, publications, blog posts, and more.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Homepage  
- `about.html`, `research.html`, `teaching.html`, `students.html`, `publications.html`, `talks.html` — Individual pages  
- `blog.html` — Blog landing page  
- `blog/` — Images and media for blog posts  
- `assets/` — All static files:
  - `css/` — Stylesheets  
  - `js/` — JavaScript  
  - `images/` — General images  
  - `pdfs/` — Publications or lecture notes  
  - `webfonts/` — Custom fonts  

## Notes

- This is a static site, so no server-side code is needed.
- To update the site, simply edit the HTML files and push to your server or GitHub Pages.

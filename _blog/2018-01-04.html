<p>In this post, I talk about a fascinating subject: the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_Fourier_series#Uniform_convergence">convergence of 
Fourier series</a> and the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon">Gibbs phenomenon</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function">Periodic</a> 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">continuous</a>
functions \(f\)
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_variation">bounded variation</a> 
have a unique and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence">uniformly convergent</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">Fourier series</a>, 
that is, the <i>partial sums</i>
$$
f_n(\theta) = \sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k\cos(k\theta) + \sum_{k=1}^{n}b_k\sin(k\theta),
$$
with <i>Fourier coefficients</i>
$$
a_k = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}f(\theta)\cos(k\theta)d\theta,
$$
and
$$
b_k = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} f(\theta) \sin(k\theta)d\theta,
$$
converge uniformly to \(f\). (Note that \(1/\pi\) is changed to \(1/(2\pi)\) for \(a_0\).) We write
$$
f(\theta) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_k\cos(k\theta) + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_k\sin(k\theta).
$$
</p>

<p>For functions \(f\) that are merely of bounded variation, the convergence is only 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_convergence">pointwise</a>:
at every point \(\theta\), the partial sums converge to \(\frac{1}{2}[f(\theta^-) + f(\theta^+)]\); 
in particular, these converge to \(f(\theta)\) at every point of continuity. What happens at points of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_discontinuities">discontinuity</a>?</p>

<p>A classical example is the square wave 
$$
f(\theta) = \frac{\pi}{4}\mathrm{sign}(\pi - \theta), \quad \theta\in[0,2\pi].
$$
This function is of bounded variation and discontinuous at \(0\), \(\pi\) and \(2\pi\).
Its Fourier coefficients can be computed analytically and are given by
$$
a_k = 0, \quad b_{2k} = 0, \quad b_{2k+1} = \frac{1}{2k+1}.
$$
When we compute the partial sums for \(n=16,32,64,128\) we obtain the picture at the top.
This is the so-called <i>Gibbs phenomenon</i>, which involves both the fact that the partial sums <i>overshoot</i> at a discontinuity and that this overshoot does not disappear as more terms are added to the sums. The overshoot at \(0\), \(\pi\) and \(2\pi\) is known exactly and is given by
$$
\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\pi}\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta}d\theta - \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}\times(0.0895\ldots),
$$
or about \(9\%\) of the jump. Note that, as \(n\) increases, the position of the overshoot moves closer 
to the discontinuity. The Gibbs phenomenon is a very standard result that most (applied) mathematicians know.</p>

<p>What is perhaps less known is a simple cure using the \((C,1)\)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_summation">Cesàro mean</a> of the partial sums, which is simply the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean">arithmetic mean</a>,
$$
\sigma_n(\theta) = \frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n}f_k(\theta).
$$
For integrable functions \(f\), one can show that \(\sigma_n(\theta)\) 
converges to \(\frac{1}{2}[f(\theta^-) + f(\theta^+)]\); in particular, 
this converges to \(f(\theta)\) at every point of continuity, 
and for continuous functions the convergence is uniform&mdash;this is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fej%C3%A9r%27s_theorem">Fejér's thereom</a>. Moreover, if \(m\leq f(\theta)\leq M\) then \(m\leq \sigma_n(\theta)\leq M\). 
Therefore, the \((C,1)\) Cesàro mean does not show the Gibbs phenomenon, as the following figure illustrates:</p>

<p>With <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~slevinrm/">Mikael Slevinsky</a>, 
we are using the \((C,2)\) Cesàro mean for 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics">spherical harmonic</a> expansions on the sphere to post-process numerical solutions of nonlocal 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation">PDEs</a>&mdash;the paper is coming soon!</p>

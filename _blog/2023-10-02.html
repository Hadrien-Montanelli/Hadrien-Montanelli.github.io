<p>In this post, I talk about a new method for computing strongly singular and near-singular integrals that arise when solving the 3D Helmholtz equation with curved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_element_method">boundary elements</a>.</p>

<h3>Background on integral equations</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_equation">Helmholtz equation</a>, which has the form
$$
\Delta u + k^2u = 0,
$$
appears when one looks for time-harmonic solutions to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">wave equation</a>&mdash;if \(v(\boldsymbol{x},t)=u(\boldsymbol{x})e^{-i\omega t}\) is a solution to \(v_{tt}=c^2\Delta v\), then \(u\) satisfies the Helmholtz equation with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavenumber">wavenumber</a> \(k=\omega /c\). It is of fundamental importance in science and engineering, with applications as diverse as noise scattering, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar">radar</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar">sonar</a> technology, and seismology. For instance, given an incident acoustic wave \(u^i\) that is a solution to the Helmholtz equation in \(\mathbb{R}^3\), the outgoing scattered field \(u^s\) generated by a bounded obstacle \(D\) is also a solution to Helmholtz equation, in \(\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\overline{D}\), with \(u^i+u^s=0\) on the boundary \(\partial D\) (for sound-soft scattering).</p>

<p>For obstacles \(D\) whose complements are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space">connected</a>, a popular technique for calculating scattered fields is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation">integral equations</a>. As an example, one can show that the solution \(u^s\) to the sound-soft scattering problem of the previous paragraph may be obtained by solving
$$
\int_{\partial D}\left\{\frac{\partial G(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})}{\partial\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{y})} - i\eta G(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})\right\}\varphi^s(\boldsymbol{y})dS(\boldsymbol{y}) + \frac{\varphi^s(\boldsymbol{x})}{2} = -u^i(\boldsymbol{x}), \;\; \boldsymbol{x}\in\partial D,
$$
for some arbitrary real number \(\eta\neq0\) such that \(\eta\mathrm{Re}(k)\geq0\). Once the equation is solved for \(\varphi^s\), the scattered field is given by 
$$
u^s(\boldsymbol{x}) =\int_{\partial D}\left\{\frac{\partial G(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})}{\partial\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{y})} - i\eta G(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y})\right\}\varphi^s(\boldsymbol{y})dS(\boldsymbol{y}), \;\; \boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^3\setminus{\overline{D}}.
$$
The function \(G\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function">Green's function</a> of the Helmholtz equation in 3D,
$$
G(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{e^{ik\vert\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}\vert}}{\vert\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}\vert}.
$$

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>One of the challenges one faces when solving integral equations is the computation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_integral">singular integrals</a>&mdash;when \(\boldsymbol{x}\) is equal to \(\boldsymbol{y}\), the Green's function and its derivatives are unbounded. There are many specialized methods to compute such integrals, including singularity subtraction, singularity cancellation, and the continuation approach. We described, in a previous <a href="https://hadrien-montanelli.github.io/2021-11-25.html">blog post</a>, algorithms to compute weakly singular integrals using singularity subtraction and the continuation approach. The term <i>weakly singular</i> refers to integrals with singularities of the same type as the Green's function. We describe, here, our method to <i>strongly singular</i> integrals, which have singularities of the same nature as the derivatives of the Green's function.</p>

<h2>Computing strongly singular integrals</h2>

<p>We consider strongly singular and near-singular integrals of the form
$$
I(\boldsymbol{x}_0) = \int_{\mathcal{T}}\frac{(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{x}_0)\cdot\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\vert\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_0\vert^3}\varphi(F^{-1}(\boldsymbol{x}))dS(\boldsymbol{x}),
$$
where \(\mathcal{T}\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) is a curved triangle defined by a polynomial transformation \(F:\widehat{T}\to\mathcal{T}\) of degree \(q\geq1\) from some reference planar triangle \(\widehat{T}\subset\mathbb{R}^2\), \(\boldsymbol{x}_0\in\mathbb{R}^3\) is a point on/or close to \(\mathcal{T}\), \(\varphi:\widehat{T}\to\mathbb{R}\) is a polynomial function of degree \(p\geq0\) (not necessarily equal to \(q\), and \(\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{x})\) is the unit normal vector at \(\boldsymbol{x}\). Our method is based on the computation of the preimage of the singularity in the reference element's space using Newton's method, singularity subtraction with Taylor-like asymptotic expansions, the continuation approach, and transplanted Gauss quadrature.</p>

<p><i>Step 1.</i> We map \(\mathcal{T}\) back to \(\widehat{T}\),
$$
I(\boldsymbol{x}_0) = \int_{\widehat{T}}\frac{(F(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})-\boldsymbol{x}_0)\cdot\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})}{\vert F(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})-\boldsymbol{x}_0\vert^3}\varphi(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})dS(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}),
$$
where \(\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}) = F_{\widehat{x}_1}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})\times F_{\widehat{x}_2}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})\).

<p><i>Step 2.</i> We compute \(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0\in\mathbb{R}^2\) such that \(F(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0)\in\mathcal{T}\) is the closest point to \(\boldsymbol{x}_0\) on \(\mathcal{T}\) (this is done with numerical optimization). We then decompose \(\boldsymbol{x}_0\) as
$$
\boldsymbol{x}_0 = F(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0) + h\frac{\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}_0}{\vert\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}_0\vert}, \quad \boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}_0 = \boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0),
$$
for some scalar \(h\), which may be negative, obtained via
$$
h = (\boldsymbol{x}_0 - F(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0)) \cdot \frac{\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}_0}{\vert\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}_0\vert}.
$$
</p>

<p><i>Step 3.</i> We compute the strongly singular term,
$$
T_{-2}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}},h) = -\frac{h\varphi_0\vert\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}_0\vert}{\left[\vert J_0(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}} - \boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0)\vert^2 + h^2\right]^{\frac{3}{2}}},
$$
where \(J_0\) is the Jacobian matrix at \(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0\) and \(\varphi_0=\varphi(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0)\), as well as the weakly singular term \(T_{-1}\). We subtract them from/add them to the integrand,
$$
I(\boldsymbol{x}_0) = \, \int_{\widehat{T}}\left[\frac{(F(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})-\boldsymbol{x}_0)\cdot\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})}{\vert F(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}})-\boldsymbol{x}_0\vert^3}\varphi(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}) - T_{-2}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}},h) - T_{-1}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}},h)\right]dS(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}) \\
+ \int_{\widehat{T}}T_{-2}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}},h)dS(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}) + \int_{\widehat{T}}T_{-1}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}},h)dS(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}).
$$
The first integral is regularized&mdash;it may be computed with Gauss quadrature on triangles. The last two integrals are singular or near-singular and will be computed in steps 4&ndash;5. 
</p>

<p><i>Step 4.</i>  Let
$$
\begin{align}
I_{-2}(h) = \int_{\widehat{T}}T_{-2}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}},h)dS(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}), \quad I_{-1}(h) = \int_{\widehat{T}}T_{-1}(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}},h)dS(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}).
\end{align}
$$
Since \(T_{-2}\) and \(T_{-1}\) are homogeneous in \(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}\) and \(h\), using the continuation approach, we reduce the 2D integrals to a sum of three 1D integrals along the edges of the shifted triangle \(\widehat{T}-\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0\). For instance, for \(I_{-2}\), this yields
$$
I_{-2}(h) = -\mathrm{sign}(h)\varphi_0\vert\boldsymbol{\widehat{n}}_0\vert\sum_{j=1}^3\widehat{s}_j\int_{\partial\widehat{T}_j-\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0}\frac{\sqrt{\vert J_0\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}\vert^2 + h^2}-\vert h\vert}{\vert J_0\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}\vert^2\sqrt{\vert J_0\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}\vert^2 + h^2}}ds(\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}),
$$
where the \(\widehat{s}_j\)'s are the distances from the origin to the edges of \(\widehat{T}-\boldsymbol{\widehat{x}}_0\). 
</p>

<p><i>Step 5.</i> To circumvent near-singularity issues in the computation of \(I_{-2}\) and \(I_{-1}\), we employ transplanted quadrature when the singularity is close to the edges. We take advantage of the a priori knowledge of the singularities to utilize transplanted rules with significantly improved convergence rates.
</p>

<h2>Numerical experiments</h2>

<p>We consider the sound-soft scattering of a plane wave \(u^i(r,\theta)=e^{ikr\cos\theta}\) by the unit sphere. We choose \(\eta=k/2\) and discretize the boundary integral equation with a boundary element method with linear basis functions/planar triangles (\(p=q=1\)) and quadratic basis functions/triangles (\(p=q=2\)). We take \(k=2\pi\), solve for \(\varphi^s\), and evaluate the far-field pattern
$$
u_\infty(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\partial D} e^{-ik\boldsymbol{\theta}\cdot\boldsymbol{y}}\varphi^s(\boldsymbol{y})dS(\boldsymbol{y}), \;\; \boldsymbol{\theta}\in\mathbb{S}^2,
$$
for an increasing number of triangles. We observe quartic superconvergence for quadratic elements as the mesh size \(h\to0\).</p>

<p>We now take \(k\in\{2\pi,4\pi,8\pi,16\pi\}\), solve for \(\varphi^s\) and seek the number of degrees of freedom needed to reach a relative error on the far-field pattern around \(10^{-3}\) for each \(k\). We observe that using quadratic elements reduces the number of degrees of freedom by a factor of about four, while also decreasing computer time by a similar factor at high frequency.</p>

<p>Welcome to the sixth and penultimate entry in my <i>Holiday in Sicily</i> series. Coincidentally, as I write this, Etna is erupting, just in time for today’s post, where I finally turn to the main volcano: the French academic and meritocratic system. The one I approached two posts ago, and which is now showing signs of violent activity. The magma chamber is fracturing. The smoke is rising. The eruption has begun.</p>

<h2>Meritocracy in theory</h2>

<p>French academia, industry, and the state itself have long been built and steered by engineers. Not just any engineers, but those trained in the elite <em>grandes écoles</em> including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_polytechnique">Polytechnique</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)">ENS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_Paris_%E2%80%93_PSL">Mines</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_des_ponts_ParisTech">Ponts</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENSTA_Paris">ENSTA</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_l%27a%C3%A9ronautique_et_de_l%27espace">ISAE</a>. These schools are more than institutions&mdash;they are pipelines into power.</p>

<p>École Polytechnique alone has produced an extraordinary roster of alumni: three Nobel laureates, legendary mathematicians such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy">Cauchy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Louis_Cholesky">Cholesky</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Liouville">Liouville</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9">Poincaré</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson">Poisson</a>, as well as heads of state like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lisabeth_Borne">Borne</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val%C3%A9ry_Giscard_d%27Estaing">Giscard d'Estaing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Lebrun">Lebrun</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadi_Carnot_(statesman)">Sadi Carnot</a>. And that’s just the beginning&mdash;many more appear on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_alumni" target="_blank">this long Wikipedia list</a>.</p>

<p>The gateway to this ruling class? National competitive exams. Thousands of students spend two grueling years in <em>classes préparatoires</em> (or <em>prépas</em>, for short) for a shot at the top. Those who pass enter the <em>grandes écoles</em>; those who don’t often fall off the radar entirely. It’s a system built on selection, stress, and prestige.</p>

<p>On paper, it’s brilliant. Two intense years, then the concours, a written exam followed by oral exams if you pass the first stage. The best succeed, regardless of wealth, or so we’re told. From there, the Republic rewards its young elite. The schools are free for low-income students and very affordable for others, typically around €5,000 per year, and completely free at institutions like Polytechnique and ENS. Careers are effectively shaped by these degrees. The school you attend often determines your entire professional trajectory, including access to specific career paths and salary scales tied directly to your alma mater.</p>

<p>I know&mdash;I walked that path. I’m from a (lower) middle-class family. I received state aid to cover tuition fees. The Republic lifted a part of the burden. For that, I am grateful. But gratitude is not silence.</p>

<p>The volcano looks majestic from afar. The slopes are clean, the summit sunlit, and the climb subsidized. But as you ascend, the air thins. The paths narrow. The terrain reveals its traps.</p>

<h2>Meritocracy in practice</h2>

<p>Let’s be honest: diversity isn’t Polytechnique’s strong suit. According to <a href="https://la-sphinx.fr/les-concours-ne-sont-pas-neutres/">a 2018 study</a>, <strong>50% of successful candidates</strong> in 2013 (MP and PC tracks) come from just <strong>two preparatory schools</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Louis-le-Grand">Louis-le-Grand</a> (Paris, public) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_priv%C3%A9_Sainte-Genevi%C3%A8ve">Sainte-Geneviève</a> (Versailles, private Catholic). These elite <em>prépas</em> can afford to run targeted preparation programs for the Polytechnique entrance exams. In contrast, other schools struggle to even cover the syllabus. The result? Students from Louis-le-Grand and Sainte-Geneviève are <strong>five times more likely</strong> to make it to the oral exams than those from “intermediate” <em>prépas</em>.</p>

<p>The numbers on diversity are bleak. In 2024, <strong>only 16.7% of admitted students were female</strong>, and that figure is declining (<a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/admission-cycle-ingenieur/sites/admission/files/content/Livret_Stats%202024%20-%202.pdf">source</a>). In terms of socioeconomic background, that same 2018 study, commented on in <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2018/10/05/a-polytechnique-l-entre-soi-en-taille-xxl_1683480/">Libération</a> and <a href="https://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/article/le-concours-de-polytechnique-favorise-t-il-la-reproduction-sociale-_8e17ad16-cad7-11e8-896c-7d05c73a49da/">Le Figaro Étudiant</a>, showed <strong>1.1% of students came from working-class backgrounds</strong> compared to <strong>29.2% nationally</strong>.</p>

<p>And the system reinforces itself. While written exams are held in regional centers, oral exams require students to travel to Paris at their own expense. Travel costs and logistics become invisible barriers. Professors from the most prestigious <em>prépas</em> have often been involved in designing the exams—or still are. That’s not a leak. That’s structural capture. Past written exams are made available online, but past oral questions are tightly guarded and circulated internally within top <em>prépas</em>. The problem isn’t just Polytechnique: <a href="https://www.ipp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/democratisation-grandes-ecoles-depuis-milieu-annees-2000-ipp-janvier-2021.pdf">a broader study</a> shows that most <em>grandes écoles</em> in France remain bastions of social reproduction.</p>

<h2>Look abroad</h2>

<p>
While France takes pride in its egalitarian ideals, the numbers suggest otherwise. When it comes to diversity in its elite institutions, we’re not doing better than the UK or US models we so often criticize. Oxford and Columbia&mdash;despite operating within systems often portrayed in France as elitist and commodified&mdash;show stronger inclusion on key metrics.
</p>

<p>At Oxford, recent admissions to mathematics show nearly <strong>28% female students</strong>, rising to <strong>44%</strong> for Math & Stats (<a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-AdmissionsStatistics2023ByCourse/AdmissionsStatistics-Proportions?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no">source</a>). In terms of social background, <strong>21.2%</strong> of Oxford students across all courses came from areas of social and economic disadvantage and from areas of low progression to higher education, a strong indicator of outreach and inclusion beyond the elite schools pipeline (<a href="https://www.savemyexams.com/learning-hub/insights/oxford-admissions-statistics/">source</a>).</p>

<p>Columbia’s data shows that <strong>39%</strong> of math and stats graduates in 2022 were women (<a href="https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/columbia-university-in-the-city-of-new-york/academic-life/academic-majors/mathematics-and-statistics/">source</a>), and while access by income remains a challenge, <strong>5.1%</strong> of students came from the bottom 20% of family income&mdash;five times higher than Polytechnique’s proportion of working-class students (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League">source</a>).</p>

<p>The lava is moving fast elsewhere. We’re still admiring the symmetry of our volcano.</p>

<h2>Inside the crater</h2>

<p>What is life like inside a <em>grande école</em>? At first glance, it’s an impressive ecosystem. The students are brilliant. I’ve taught at Oxford and Columbia, and while those institutions attract extraordinary minds from across the world, I’d argue that, on average, a Polytechnique student is stronger technically. France’s top engineering schools produce sharp, driven individuals with an admirable ambition. But that’s only half the story.</p>

<p>The academic schedule is intense. More than 30 hours of classes per week with lectures followed by two-hour tutorials. It’s immediate, heavy, and gives students little time to digest what they’ve learned. The format is rigorous, by design. As a consequence, attendance is often poor. A turnout of two-thirds is considered good. Some students treat their allowed absences as paid leave. Once, a student told me “Since I haven’t missed anything yet, I’ll skip next week’s tutorial and enjoy a long weekend.” At Polytechnique, where I currently teach, and at ENSTA, where I taught previously, this attitude is not uncommon. The entitlement can be striking.</p>

<p>And when policies change&mdash;when, for example, the administration at ENSTA decided to tighten rules around absences&mdash;students went on strike. They sat in protest outside the library. It was all very French. And very privileged.</p>

<p>What many don’t realize is just how fortunate they are. At the start of each term, once I’ve gauged the mood, I often tell my students how much tuition costs at Columbia. Their jaws drop. They have no idea. The education they’re receiving is state-funded, world-class, and largely taken for granted. That’s not a personal failing, it’s structural. But it’s still hard to ignore.</p>

<p>And they’re expensive. Very. The lectures are usually given by a single, high-ranking professor, and then students are split into groups of about 20 for tutorials&mdash;each group tutored by another academic, often less senior but not always. Imagine the cost of that structure: one professor for the lectures, and a dozen more for the tutorials. Add to this the funding for sports facilities, student clubs, and countless associations. I’m not complaining, I benefited from this system, but let’s be honest: it’s a serious investment of public money.</p>

<p>At Polytechnique, for example, a single engineering student can cost the state up to €40,000 per year (<a href="https://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/polytechnique-a-nouveau-epinglee-par-la-cour-des-comptes.html" target="_blank">source</a>). That’s about four times the national average for higher education students (<a href="https://publication.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/eesr/FR/T496/la_depense_d_education_pour_l_enseignement_superieur/#ILL_EESR17_ES_01_04" target="_blank">source</a>). This figure does <em>not</em> include the salary students receive. Yes, unlike most students in the world, Polytechnique students not only study for free: they are paid a monthly salary. It’s one of the most generous public education systems on Earth. If the average French taxpayer were told they’re funding students who skip tutorials, would they accept it?</p>

<h2>Rebuilding the landscape</h2>

<p>The volcano is no longer dormant. Its foundations are cracking. Our model of meritocracy is eroding from within. It feeds on the myth of neutrality while entrenching inequality. It’s time to redraw the map. Here are proposals&mdash;not reforms, but tectonic shifts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Create regional centers of excellence</strong>; starting in high school or earlier.</li>
  <li><strong>Free tuition for low-income students at these centers</strong>; others contribute.</li>
  <li><strong>Hold both written and oral exams locally</strong>, at these centers.</li>
  <li><strong>Introduce quotas</strong> for women and students from modest backgrounds; at these centers, not in the exams.</li>
  <li><strong>Make these centers attractive for top professors</strong>, with competitive salaries and benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>Abolish private (and especially religious) <em>prépas</em></strong>; public means public.</li>
  <li><strong>Publish a national database</strong> of all past written <em>and</em> oral questions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dormant no more</h2>

<p>From a distance, the volcano was beautiful&mdash;perfect symmetry, noble ascent. But I’ve stood on its rim, and what I saw wasn’t glory. Smoke can be spun. Exams can be dressed in neutrality. But lava doesn’t lie, it flows where inequality has cracked the ground. The eruption has begun. And in forty-eight hours, the mountain will speak in flames.</p>

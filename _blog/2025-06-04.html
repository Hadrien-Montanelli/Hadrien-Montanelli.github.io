<p>Welcome to the seventh and last entry in my <i>Holiday in Sicily</i> series. Here we are. The full eruption. It’s no coincidence I’m writing this from Sicily, flying back over Etna’s crater. I call it Mafia, and I’m a quarter Italian, so I get a pass. But this isn’t a vendetta; it’s a reflection. And yes, I love my lab, I love my job, and I know how incredibly privileged I am. Tenure with no grant pressure, no publishing quotas. Most researchers land a permanent job after one or two postdocs. Then you’re a civil servant&mdash;and short of criminal activity, you can never be fired. Sounds amazing, right?</p>

  The views expressed in this post are entirely my own and do not represent the official position of any institution I am affiliated with. This is a personal reflection based on my individual experience across different academic systems. It is written in a deliberately informal and critical tone, with the intent to spark discussion, not to discredit or disrespect any person or institution. The Mafia metaphor is used satirically to highlight certain structural dynamics with irony and is not intended to accuse anyone of actual wrongdoing.

<h2>The Mafia doesn’t like outsiders</h2>

<p>People warned me: the French academic system is incredibly closed. I didn’t fully understand what they meant until I saw it. In many labs, people come from the same advisor or their academic offspring. Me? I’ve been called “the American,” even though I’m French and did my undergrad in France. I just spent a few years abroad: four in the UK, three in the US. Someone once told me not to speak English in the coffee room, “We won’t hire internationals otherwise.” Not a joke.</p>

<p>More broadly, coming back to France was a cultural shock. I missed the <a href="https://hadrien-montanelli.github.io/2020-10-25.html">COVID-era chloroquine debates</a>. I wasn’t prepared for the hijab discourse. Bias here is subtle but pervasive, and you don’t realize how saturated the environment is until you’ve seen the outside world. Most people haven’t, I can’t blame them.</p>

<p>It wasn’t easy to infiltrate the Mafia. But I finally got in two years ago. Today, I’m a permanent researcher at Inria, i.e., a civil servant for life, and I also hold a teaching position at École Polytechnique as a <em>Professeur Chargé de Cours</em>. I landed my dream jobs, and I’m genuinely grateful to those who supported me along the way. Now, let’s dive into the different types of positions and how the Mafia protects its own.</p>

<h2>Ranks and roles in the family</h2>

<p>The French academic Mafia operates through two main channels: CNRS and Inria. These are the elite research-only positions. There's also the <em>Maître de Conférences</em> (MCF), the backbone of university teaching. A few new positions exist, such as CPJ, <em>Chaires de Professeur Junior</em>, but I won’t go into those here.</p>

<h4>CNRS &amp; Inria</h4>

<p>These are the top research roles in France:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CNRS:</strong> You apply to a department within a university or engineering school affiliated with CNRS. The position is officially research-only, but you're allowed to teach and get paid extra for it. In practice, especially when you're early in your career, you often teach to support the lab.</li>
  <li><strong>Inria:</strong> You apply directly to a project team (typically 5-10 people). These teams may be hosted by a university, engineering school, or by Inria itself in one of its research centers. Again, it's technically research-only, but teaching is common and appreciated.</li>
  <li>Salary is decent. If you add a bit of teaching, it becomes competitive, usually better than UK starting salaries. And the freedom is real: no mandatory teaching, full research focus, and appreciation (plus cash) if you do help out.</li>
</ul>

<h4>MCF (Maître de Conférences)</h4>

<p>This is the standard university role: 192 hours of teaching per year, plus research. The pay is low, the teaching load heavy, and the conditions aren’t great, often at underfunded universities, with little support and students who struggle. It’s an unappealing option compared to the research-only tracks.</p>

<h2>Joining the family</h2>

<p>Let me now explain how you get made in the French research Mafia. The CNRS process is mostly the same as Inria’s, with a few small differences.</p>

<h4>Inria Hiring Process</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1: Dossier.</strong> About 20 pages. Inria provides a well-structured template (I’m happy to share mine). At Saclay, for example, each year: 100+ applicants, 15 shortlisted and interviewed, three hired until 2023 (two now).</li>
  <li><strong>Team support is crucial.</strong> You need the backing of the project team. They'll be consulted and asked to write an evaluation. They may also help with your dossier. Without their support, your application is dead on arrival. If you’re a total outsider, you have almost no chance.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2: Oral.</strong> A 15-minute presentation plus questions. You present to a panel of about ten people. One of them knows your field; the others don’t. Your job is to win over that one expert as they’ll make the case for you behind closed doors.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3: The Re-Ranking.</strong> After the orals, a smaller committee of three people (only one of whom saw your talk) can re-rank the candidates based on opaque internal criteria.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me illustrate Step 3 with actual data. What’s nice is that, for all these civil-servant jobs, the final rankings are publicly <a href="http://postes.smai.emath.fr/current/index.php">available online</a>. The table below shows the number of visible re-rankings, i.e., candidates who changed positions between oral and final results. This does <em>not</em> include people who disappeared entirely from the list (likely because they accepted other offers).</p>

<h4>MCF Hiring Process</h4>

<p>It’s closer to the UK/US model but with very French twists:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Application:</strong> A dossier and a single, short oral interview. No seminar, no visit day, no real chance to meet the department.</li>
  <li><strong>Letters of recommendation:</strong> Technically illegal under French law. But you’re still expected to send them <em>unofficially</em> to the jury president. The problem? Their name is often missing from the job ad. So you have to guess. Email lab members. Piece clues together. Classic French <em>coutume</em>. Once, a colleague told me the custom was actually to wait: the jury would ask for letters <em>after</em> shortlisting. Supposedly, this avoids students with no chance from bothering senior people for letters. Reasonable. So I waited. But then I got an interview and was grilled by a member for not having any letters: “Why does no one want to recommend you?” <em>Che cazzo?</em></li>
  <li><strong>Ranking system:</strong> On a website straight out of the 90s. Candidates rank jobs, jobs rank candidates. The top match gets the offer. If they decline, it goes to the next one, and so on. But labs fear the job will fall to someone who’s already accepted elsewhere, so they rank only those who seem fully committed. If you’re too strong (say, shortlisted at Inria or CNRS, info that’s public), they might not rank you at all. Just to avoid “wasting” the offer.</li>
  <li>And yet, another custom: Inria juries often check how you fared with MCF jobs. So you still need to apply to ten or more, just to show you’re competitive. Make it make sense.</li>
  <li><strong>Bonus anecdote:</strong> In Toulouse, I got scolded because my slides were in English. Truly a vibe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Life inside the family</h2>

<p>Once you’re inside the system, it’s easy to understand why many people never leave. The work-life balance is extraordinary: long lunches, generous vacation time, and flexible work arrangements. That’s a gift, but it can also come with a hidden cost: insulation. In many labs, productivity norms are self-referential. A strong PhD here might publish one or two papers. In the US or UK, that would often be the baseline.</p>

<p>This isn’t a question of metrics for their own sake. It’s about the ambition to push boundaries and the cultural energy that supports that ambition. I had the luck of being shaped by environments where people combined rigor, drive, and joy in their work. That shaped my expectations, probably forever. So yes, I sometimes find it hard to adjust to the local tempo. But I’m learning that excellence can wear many masks: with publications, quality can matter more than quantity.</p>

<h2>French admin as the Mafia’s iron hand</h2>

<p>I couldn’t not mention French administration. As civil servants, we deal with it constantly and its rigidity is part of daily life. I used to think all bureaucracy was terrible. Then I left France and realized: French admin is uniquely dysfunctional.</p>

<p>Take letters of recommendation for MCF. When I called HR because I didn't know what the rule was, the person on the line said, with a condescending tone, “By law, you can’t submit letters of recommendation. Period. I can’t help you.” It was astonishingly unhelpful&mdash;and frankly, dismissive. Not to mention that reimbursements for conferences or payments for extra teaching hours can take anywhere from three to five months and that very same HR can't be bothered to speed it up.</p>

<p>Hiring an intern is a full-blown bureaucratic saga. An administrative assistant told me: “You must send the hiring request at least two months in advance.” Why? Because seven different people have to sign off, and each signature takes about a week. Two full months to rehire someone we already knew&mdash;a brilliant student from our Master’s program and a former intern of mine. But because he’s on the autism spectrum, the delays were especially stressful and hard for him. Thankfully, Corinne Chen, an administrative assistant at ENSTA, helped us bypass the system and hire him through a different channel. She’s incredible, and I’m terrified at the thought of her retiring soon. She’s spent her life fighting her own kind of Mafia&mdash;the patriarchy. She reminds me of my mother: a strong woman who raised five kids on her own. (Funnily enough, as I write this, an administrative assistant just emailed me to say the books I ordered back in November finally arrived&mdash;a month ago. But someone still needs to stamp and catalogue them, and that hasn't happened yet. Classic.)</p>

<p>French admin isn’t much better outside of work. My <em>carte vitale</em> (national health card) took four months. A passport photo was rejected while I was applying in person because the date printed on the sheet was from 13 months ago, just over the official 12-month limit. I cut the date off with the clerk’s scissors&mdash;“Voilà!”&mdash;but she simply replied, “They’ll know.” I asked how. She said the government can track photobooth systems. Honestly, go touch grass.</p>

<p>The real issue isn’t the rules themselves, it’s the robotic, blind enforcement of them. On the road here, no one follows rules: bikes run red lights, cars never stop, pedestrians cross wherever they want. In admin, it’s the opposite: zero flexibility.</p>

<h2>After the eruption</h2>

<p>The ground has stopped trembling, the lava has cooled, and the ash has settled. In the stillness, it’s easier to see the landscape for what it is. Scarred, yes, but fertile too.</p>

<p>I don’t blame them. Most people haven’t seen how it works elsewhere, and maybe it’s better that way. But we can do better. The Mafia is strong but not unbeatable. Despite all this, I still believe in the French system. We’re not obsessed with metrics. We don’t treat academia like war. Most of us just want to make good math, good science. Let’s keep that spirit but show up a bit more, stay open to the world, and realize how privileged we are.</p>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.08900.pdf">One of the papers</a> I wrote during my Ph.D. at Oxford was just accepted in <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/mathematics-and-computers-in-simulation">Mathematics and Computers in Simulation</a>. In this post, I review the main ideas of the paper.

<h2>Periodic stiff PDEs</h2>

We are interested in computing smooth solutions of stiff PDEs of the form

$$
u_t = \mathcal{S}(u) = \mathcal{L}u + \mathcal{N}(u), \quad u(0,X)=u_0(X), \quad \text{periodic boundary conditions,}
$$

where $$u(t,X)$$ is a function of time $$t$$ and space $$X$$, $$\mathcal{L}$$ is a linear differential operator with constant coefficients on a domain in one, 
two or three space dimensions and $$\mathcal{N}$$ is a nonlinear differential (or non-differential) operator of lower order with constant coefficients and on the same domain.

In applications, PDEs of this kind typically arise when two or more different physical processes are combined, and many PDEs of interest in 
science and engineering take this form. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korteweg%E2%80%93de_Vries_equation">Korteweg--de Vries equation</a> $$u_t = -u_{xxx} - uu_x$$, the starting point of the study of nonlinear waves and solitons, couples third-order linear dispersion with first-order convection, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allenâ€“Cahn_equation">Allen--Cahn equation</a> $$u_t = \epsilon u_{xx} + u - u^3$$ couples second-order linear 
diffusion with a nondifferentiated cubic reaction term. 

Often a system of equations rather than a single scalar equation is involved, for example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system">reaction-diffusion systems</a> such as the Gray--Scott and Schnakenberg equations, which involve two components coupled together. (The importance of coupling of nonequal diffusion constants in science was made famous by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> in 1952 in the most highly-cited of all his papers.) Fourth-order terms also arise, for example in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation">Cahn--Hilliard equation</a>, whose solutions describe structures of alloys, and in the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto%E2%80%93Sivashinsky_equation">Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation</a>, related to combustion problems among others, whose solutions are chaotic. The figure at the top of this post shows six examples of solutions of such PDEs.

<h2>Discretization in Fourier space</h2>

Our paper describes and compares specialized methods that take advantage of two special features of the family of PDEs above. The first one is the periodic boundary conditions.
This allows us to discretize the spatial component with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_method">Fourier spectral method</a> on $$N$$ points; the PDE becomes a system of $$N$$ ODEs,

$$
\hat{u}' = \mathbf{L}\hat{u} + \mathbf{N}(\hat{u}), \quad \hat{u}(0)=\hat{u}_0,
$$

where $$\hat{u}(t)$$ is the vector of $$N$$ Fourier coefficients of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation">trigonometric interpolant</a> of $$u(t,X)$$ at time $$t$$, and $$\mathbf{L}$$ (a $$N\times N$$ matrix) and $$\mathbf{N}$$ are the discretized versions of $$\mathcal{L}$$ and $$\mathcal{N}$$ in Fourier space. 

For example, in 1D on $$[0, 2\pi]$$ with $$\mathcal{L}u=u_{xx}$$ and an even number $$N$$ of equispaced grid points $$\{x_j=2\pi j/N\}_{j=0}^{N-1}$$, we look for a solution $$u(t,x)$$ of the form

$$
u(t,x) \approx \sum_{k=-N/2}^{N/2}{\hspace{-0.3cm}}'{\;\,} \hat{u}_k(t) e^{ikx}
$$

with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">Fourier coefficients</a>

$$
\hat{u}_k(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}u(t,x_j)e^{-ikx_j}, \quad -\frac{N}{2}\leq k\leq \frac{N}{2}-1, \quad \hat{u}_{N/2}(t) = \hat{u}_{-N/2}(t).
$$

(The prime on the summation sign signifies that the terms $$k=\pm N/2$$ are halved.) Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">FFT</a> codes only store $$N$$ coefficients, the vector $$\hat{u}(t)$$ is defined as

$$
\hat{u}(t) = \Big(\frac{\hat{u}_{-N/2}}{2}+\frac{\hat{u}_{N/2}}{2}, \hat{u}_{-N/2+1}(t),\ldots,\hat{u}_{N/2-1}(t)\Big)^T.
$$

For this PDE, $$\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{D}_N^{(2)}$$ is the (diagonal) <i>second-order Fourier differentiation matrix</i> with entries $$-k^2$$, $$-N/2\leq k\leq N/2-1$$. Note that stiffness is related to $$\mathbf{L}$$ having large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors">eigenvalues</a> since stability of spectral methods for time-dependent PDEs requires that the eigenvalues, scaled by the time-step, lie in the stability region of the time-stepping formula.


<h2>A simple expoential integrator</h2>

The second special feature of these PDEs is that they are is semilinear, <i>i.e.</i>, the higher-order terms of the equation are linear. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_integrator">Exponential integrators</a> are a class of numerical methods for systems of ODEs that are aimed at taking advantage of this. The linear part $$\mathbf{L}$$, responsible for the stiffness, is integrated exactly using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential">matrix exponential</a> while a numerical scheme is applied to $$\mathbf{N}$$. 

One of the simplest exponential integrators, commonly known as the Exponential Time Differencing (ETD) Euler method, is given by

$$
\hat{u}^{n+1} = e^{h\mathbf{L}}\hat{u}^n + h\varphi_1(h\mathbf{L})\mathbf{N}(\hat{u}^n),
$$

where $$h=t_{n+1}-t_n$$ is the time-step and

$$
\varphi_1(z) = \frac{e^z-1}{z}.
$$

Note that, in practice, the nonlinear evaluations $$\mathbf{N}(\hat{u}^n)$$ is carried out in value space, that is, $$\mathbf{N}(\hat{u}^n)$$ means $$\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{N}(\mathbf{F}^{-1}\hat{u}^n))$$, with discrete Fourier transform $$\mathbf{F}$$. Since the matrix $$\mathbf{L}$$ diagonal, computing the matrix exponential and matrix-vector products cost only $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ operations. The dominant cost per time-step is therefore the cost of an FFT, <i>i.e.</i>, $$\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$$ operations.

<h2>Results of our numerical experiments and Chebfun</h2>

We compare in our paper 30 exponential integrators of fourth and higher order on 11 model problems in 1D, 2D and 3D. Our conclusion is that it is hard to do much better than one of the simplest of these formulas, the ETDRK4 scheme of Cox and Matthews.

Our numerical experiments were performed using <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> and have been embedded within <a href="https://www.chebfun.org/">Chebfun</a>. More specifically, the <code>spin</code>, <code>spin2</code> and <code>spin3</code> codes implement a Fourier spectral method and exponential integrators to solve PDEs in 1D, 2D and 3D periodic domains. The simplest way to see <code>spin</code> in action is to type simply <code>spin('ks')</code> (for the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation) or <code>spin2('gl')</code> (for the 2D Ginzburg--Landau equation) to invoke an example computation.
It is also possible to define your own PDE using the <code>spinop</code> class. Check out the <a href="https://www.chebfun.org/docs/guide/guide19.html">documentation</a> for details.
